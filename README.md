# Lunabotics 2024 - team ARES for SDSU

Take note that we're currently using these distros:  Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, ROS2 foxy


## To learn more about how to use Linux terminals & the CLI (Command Line Interface):
 - This [website](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) is a good place to start.
 - You can also try playing this [interactive terminal game](https://hub.ovh2.mybinder.org/user/nthiery-bashcrawl-rol3vedn/lab) (1/10, not very fun), or just use its terminal as a playground for trying out 
 the commands you learn.
 - Google "common Linux commands"!
 If you want your own real Linux system to mess around with, I can get you a Raspberry Pi to SSH to, just let me know.
