On D, with mode light on:
    left joystick has x and y axis values of [-1,1] with 0 being neutral
    right joystick has x and y axis values of [0,255] with 127 or 128 being neutral

USE THIS ONE :
On D, with mode light off:
    both joysticks have x and y axis values of [0,255] with 127 or 128 being neutral
        in joy, this becomes [-1,1] 32 bit float with 16 decimal places with 0 being neutral
    all buttons and triggers are boolean

On X, with mode light on:
    left joystick has x and y axis values of [-1,1] with 0 being neutral
    right joystick has x and y axis values of [-32768, 32767] with 128 being neutral for x, -129 being neutral for y

On X, with mode light off:
    both joysticks have x and y axis values of [-32768, 32767] with 128 being neutral for x, -129 being neutral for y
